Issues:
At dusk, if no lightsource, OR if night,  timeOfDay isn't output to html because newDay triggers immediately. Need to move newDay out of that function...to where?

Crafting: Maybe drag-and-drop images from inventory to 'crafting area' of main window. If the right components are placed there, new item is crafted? This should take time!



ToDo:

I think I need a "Turn" function that wraps everything that can occur during a turn.  The turn function (if it wraps everything else) should first check to see if timeOfDay is 'night'(or dusk without light source), and if so it needs to disallow any activity. Maybe the entire activity menu area is replaced by a large 'sleep' button. If activity is allowed, normal turn progress and options are available. This may solve item 1 on the ToDo list.

Need to define the 'game over' condition.

Need to decide how to handle inventory. Inv should be an array, but each item should be an object with properties and maybe even methods. Can I have an array of objects?

How can inventory items be displayed graphically?  Open inventory button/image and see inventory represented as icons.  Or just display inventory as icons without putting them 'in a sack'.



------------------- How it all plays out ------------------------
We need a turn clock to limit actions within each day, and measure the health/status of the player as the game progresses. If he's doing well, he'll be healthy, if he isn't, he'll die. Game over!

Divide each day into turns. Each turn is two hours. 12 hours of daylight = 6 turns per day w/o light source. Player awarded one extra turn per day (dusk) if he has a lightsource. As currentTime is an array, dawn is time '0', and dusk is time '6', but that equals 7 turns (if a light source is present). An 8th turn is for "night". If there is no light source, then the end of turn #6 needs to call a newDay(). So there are now 14 hours of potential 'light' in which to take actions, and a "nighttime" period which will be either 10 or 12 hours...depending on the presence of a lightsource. Note that the hours are not necessary, only the time periods. We do not need to track turns available, only record the passage of time throughout the day.

Each turn, player can take one action (explore, craft, rest, ...). After that action, we need to advance the timeOfDay. 

What if player sleeps during the day? Don't make the 'sleep' function advance the day, only the turn. Make this a 'nap' function for one turn which restores x energy.
